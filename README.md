# UE Nodes

UE nodes are "Use Everywhere".

Put a `UE CLIP` into your workflow, and connect it's input (ignore it's output).

Then any node, anywhere in the workflow, which needs a CLIP input will get it automatically, if left unconnected.

It's as the UE CLIP output was connected to every unconnected CLIP input.
